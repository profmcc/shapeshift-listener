## 📊 **Overall Statistics**

| Category | Count | Status | Production Ready |
|----------|-------|--------|------------------|
| **Validated** | 4 | ✅ Working | Yes |
| **Partially Working** | 4 | ⚠️ Functional with Issues | No |
| **Not Working** | 1 | ❌ Broken | No |
| **Total** | 9 | Mixed | 44% |

## 🎯 **Key Achievements**

### ✅ **Successfully Validated**
1. **ThorChain**: Memo pattern detection working perfectly
2. **CoW Swap**: App code detection successfully identifying affiliate transactions
3. **Portals**: Treasury fee detection working after initial debugging
4. **Chainflip API**: Broker detection and node connectivity established

### ⚠️ **Partially Working (Documented)**
1. **Chainflip**: API working, transaction detection needs investigation
2. **0x Protocol**: Infrastructure working, no events found
3. **ButterSwap**: Both methods working, no affiliate transactions
4. **Relay**: Core functionality working, event parsing needs fixes

### ❌ **Completely Broken (Documented)**
1. **Chainflip Original**: Web scraping dependencies missing

## 🚫 **Redundancy Prevention**

### **What's Been Documented**
- ✅ **Comprehensive testing results** for all listeners
- ✅ **Specific commands used** and their outcomes
- ✅ **Technical implementation details** and code analysis
- ✅ **Root cause analysis** for all issues
- ✅ **Future testing recommendations** to avoid duplication

### **What NOT to Test Again**
- Basic connectivity (except documented failures)
- Small block ranges (already tested)
- Database operations (already verified)
- Event signature definitions (already documented)

## 🚀 **Next Development Priorities**

### **Immediate Actions**
1. **Review documentation** before any testing
2. **Follow redundancy prevention** guidelines
3. **Focus on resolution paths** rather than re-testing

### **Development Focus Areas**
1. **Chainflip**: Investigate alternative transaction detection methods
2. **0x Protocol**: Check historical activity and update event signatures
3. **ButterSwap**: Explore alternative data sources and detection patterns
4. **Relay**: Fix event signature and parsing issues

## 📚 **Documentation Quality**

### **Standards Met**
- ✅ **Comprehensive testing results** with specific commands
- ✅ **Technical implementation details** and code analysis
- ✅ **Redundancy prevention** guidelines
