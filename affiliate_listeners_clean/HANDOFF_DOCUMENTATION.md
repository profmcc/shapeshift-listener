# ShapeShift Affiliate Fee Tracker - Project Handoff

## Product Specification

### What We Want to Achieve
**End Goal**: A comprehensive affiliate fee tracking system that provides complete visibility into all ShapeShift affiliate transactions across multiple DeFi protocols.

### Core Data Requirements
1. **Transaction Details**
   - Transaction Hash: Unique identifier for each transaction
   - Block Number & Timestamp: When the transaction occurred
   - Protocol Source: Which protocol generated the affiliate fee (CoW Swap, THORChain, Portals, Relay, etc.)
   - Chain: Which blockchain the transaction occurred on

2. **Asset Information**
   - Input Asset: Token being swapped FROM (symbol, address, amount)
   - Output Asset: Token being swapped TO (symbol, address, amount)
   - Asset Amounts: Precise amounts traded (both input and output)
   - USD Values: Dollar values of both input and output amounts

3. **Address Information**
   - From Address: User's wallet address initiating the transaction
   - Receiving Address: User's wallet address receiving the output
   - Affiliate Address: ShapeShift's affiliate address receiving the fee

4. **Affiliate Fee Validation**
   - Expected Fee Rate: 55 basis points (0.55%)
   - Actual Fee Collected: What was actually paid to ShapeShift
   - Fee Token: Which token the affiliate fee was paid in
   - Fee USD Value: Dollar value of the affiliate fee collected
   - Validation: Compare expected vs. actual to detect manipulation

5. **Security & Compliance**
   - Rate Verification: Ensure no modified versions with 0% fees
   - Real-time Monitoring: Detect anomalies in affiliate fee collection
   - Historical Analysis: Track fee rate changes over time

### Data Output Format
Each transaction should provide:
```
source,chain,tx_hash,block_number,block_timestamp,block_date,
input_token,input_amount,input_amount_usd,output_token,output_amount,output_amount_usd,
sender,recipient,affiliate_address,expected_fee_bps,actual_fee_bps,
affiliate_fee_token,affiliate_fee_amount,affiliate_fee_usd,volume_usd,
created_at,created_date
```

### Business Value
- Revenue Transparency
- Rate Compliance
- Performance Analysis across protocols and chains
- Fraud Detection
- Regulatory Compliance

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- Relay transactions exist (2,342 found in last 100 blocks)
- **NO AffiliateFee events found** in recent blocks
- Current detection method assumes events that don't exist
- Need to investigate actual Relay affiliate mechanism

**Implementation Details**:
