# üîç Chainflip Transaction Investigation Summary

## üìä **Current Status: INVESTIGATION IN PROGRESS**

### **üéØ Key Finding**
**ShapeShift brokers exist on Chainflip but we cannot detect their transactions using current RPC methods.**

## üîç **What We've Discovered**

### **‚úÖ Infrastructure Confirmed**
1. **Chainflip Node**: Successfully connected and querying
2. **ShapeShift Brokers**: Found 2 broker addresses with balances
3. **Multi-Chain Support**: Brokers support Ethereum, Bitcoin, Polkadot, Arbitrum, Solana
4. **USDC Balance**: First broker has 4,239.62 USDC

### **‚ùå Transaction Detection Failed**
1. **Scheduled Swaps**: API parameter issues (needs specific asset specifiers)
2. **Prewitness Swaps**: API parameter issues (needs specific asset specifiers)  
3. **Pool Orders**: API parameter issues (needs specific asset specifiers)
4. **LP Order Fills**: Found 3 fills, no ShapeShift activity
5. **Screening Events**: Found 3 events, no ShapeShift activity
6. **Deposit Channels**: Found 20 channels, no ShapeShift activity
7. **Pending Broadcasts**: Found 5 broadcasts, no ShapeShift activity

### **üîç Patterns Found**
- **Fee References**: Found "fee" patterns in recent blocks (could be affiliate fees)
- **Data Structures**: Successfully accessing various Chainflip data types
- **API Connectivity**: All RPC methods responding (though with parameter issues)

## üöÄ **Root Cause Analysis**

### **1. API Parameter Issues**
The main transaction methods require specific asset parameters:
- `cf_scheduled_swaps` needs asset specifiers like `["ETH"]` or `["BTC"]`
- `cf_prewitness_swaps` needs asset specifiers
- `cf_pool_orders` needs asset specifiers

### **2. Broker Address Mismatch**
- **Expected**: `cFMeDPtPHccVYdBSJKTtCYuy7rewFNpro3xZBKaCGbSS2xhRi`
- **Expected**: `cFK6mYjpajcwPDZ7JUsac8XUoVSJnhjL43ZMZW7YoN8HE4dD8`
- **Reality**: These addresses exist but no transactions found

### **3. Transaction Format Unknown**
- ShapeShift transactions might use different naming conventions
- Could be in different data structures than expected
- Might use different broker addresses than documented

## üìã **What We Need to Do Next**

### **Immediate Actions**
1. **Check Chainflip Explorer**: Examine actual ShapeShift transaction format
2. **Find Correct Broker Addresses**: Look for active broker addresses
3. **Identify Transaction Structure**: Understand how transactions are stored
4. **Test Asset-Specific Queries**: Use correct asset parameters

### **Technical Investigation**
1. **Asset-Specific Queries**: Test `cf_scheduled_swaps(["ETH"])` etc.
2. **Different RPC Methods**: Try methods we haven't tested yet
3. **Block Event Analysis**: Look deeper into block events for transactions
4. **Address Pattern Matching**: Search for different address patterns

### **Data Source Verification**
1. **Explorer vs API**: Compare what's visible on explorer vs API
2. **Transaction Format**: Understand the actual data structure
3. **Broker Identification**: Find how brokers are identified in transactions

## üéØ **Next Steps for Production**

### **Phase 1: Investigation**
1. **Manual Explorer Check**: Examine actual ShapeShift transactions
2. **Address Discovery**: Find correct broker addresses
3. **Format Analysis**: Understand transaction data structure

### **Phase 2: Implementation**
1. **Correct API Usage**: Use proper asset parameters
2. **Transaction Detection**: Implement working detection logic
3. **Data Extraction**: Extract relevant transaction information

### **Phase 3: Production**
1. **Real-time Monitoring**: Set up continuous transaction monitoring
2. **Affiliate Fee Tracking**: Monitor fee generation
3. **Performance Metrics**: Track broker activity and success rates

## üí° **Key Insights**

### **What We Know**
- Chainflip infrastructure is working
- ShapeShift brokers exist and have balances
- Multiple data sources are accessible
- Fee-related activity is happening

### **What We Don't Know**
- How ShapeShift transactions are structured
- What broker addresses are actually active
- Which RPC methods contain the transaction data
- How to properly query for specific assets

### **What We Need to Learn**
- Actual transaction format from explorer
- Correct broker addresses in use
- Proper API parameter usage
- Alternative data sources for transactions

## üö® **Critical Next Step**

**Check the Chainflip explorer for actual ShapeShift transactions to understand:**
1. **Transaction Format**: How transactions are structured
2. **Broker Addresses**: What addresses are actually used
3. **Data Fields**: What information is available
4. **Naming Conventions**: How ShapeShift is identified

---

**Conclusion**: The investigation has revealed that while the infrastructure is working, we need to understand the actual transaction format from the Chainflip explorer to properly implement transaction detection. The current RPC methods are accessible but require correct parameters and understanding of the data structure.
