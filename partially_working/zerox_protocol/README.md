# 🎯 0x Protocol Listener

## 📋 **Current Status**
**Status**: PARTIALLY WORKING  
**Last Tested**: August 20, 2025  
**Classification**: Technically functional but no affiliate transactions detected

## 📁 **Contents**
- `zerox_listener.py` - Main blockchain listener for 0x Protocol
- `zerox_transactions.db` - SQLite database for storing transactions
- `ZEROX_PROTOCOL_HANDOFF_PARTIALLY_WORKING.md` - Comprehensive testing documentation

## 🔍 **What Works**
- ✅ Multi-chain connectivity (6/7 chains)
- ✅ Block scanning and progress tracking
- ✅ Database initialization and management
- ✅ Event signature monitoring
- ✅ Error handling and rate limiting

## 🚨 **What Doesn't Work**
- ❌ No 0x Protocol events detected in recent blocks
- ❌ No ShapeShift affiliate transactions found
- ❌ Avalanche chain connection fails
- ❌ BSC hits rate limits

## 🎯 **Key Features**
- **Supported Chains**: Ethereum, Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum, Base, BSC
- **Event Types**: Fill, Cancel, TransformERC20, ERC20Transfer
- **Affiliate Detection**: ShapeShift address monitoring across chains
- **Database**: SQLite with proper indexing

## 🚫 **Redundancy Prevention**
This folder contains comprehensive documentation of what was tested and what didn't work. **DO NOT** retest:
- Basic connectivity (except Avalanche)
- Small/medium block ranges
- Current event detection logic
- Basic database operations

## 🚀 **Next Steps**
See `ZEROX_PROTOCOL_HANDOFF_PARTIALLY_WORKING.md` for detailed:
- What TO test in future
- Root cause analysis
- Technical implementation details
- Testing commands used
