# 📋 Partially Working Listeners - Summary

## 🎯 **Overview**
This directory contains listeners that are **technically functional** but have **specific issues** preventing them from being fully production-ready. These listeners have been thoroughly tested and documented to avoid redundant testing in the future.

## 📁 **Current Contents**

### 🔗 **Chainflip** (`chainflip/`)
**Status**: PARTIALLY WORKING  
**Last Tested**: August 20, 2025  
**Classification**: Node connection successful, transaction detection failed

**What Works**:
- ✅ Successfully connects to Chainflip Mainnet APIs
- ✅ Identifies ShapeShift broker addresses with balances
- ✅ Multi-chain support (Ethereum, Bitcoin, Polkadot, Arbitrum, Solana)
- ✅ Database operations and CSV export

**What Doesn't Work**:
- ❌ Transaction detection methods all failed
- ❌ RPC parameter issues with swap-related methods
- ❌ No actual swap transactions found despite broker activity
- ❌ Extensive debugging revealed fundamental API limitations

**Key Files**:
- `csv_chainflip_api_listener.py` - API-based listener
- Multiple debugging and investigation scripts
- Comprehensive testing documentation
- `CHAINFLIP_FINAL_INVESTIGATION_SUMMARY.md`

### 🎯 **0x Protocol** (`zerox_protocol/`)
**Status**: PARTIALLY WORKING  
**Last Tested**: August 20, 2025  
**Classification**: Technically functional but no affiliate transactions detected

**What Works**:
- ✅ Multi-chain connectivity (6/7 chains)
- ✅ Block scanning and progress tracking
- ✅ Database initialization and management
- ✅ Event signature monitoring
- ✅ Error handling and rate limiting

**What Doesn't Work**:
- ❌ No 0x Protocol events detected in recent blocks
- ❌ No ShapeShift affiliate transactions found
- ❌ Avalanche chain connection fails
- ❌ BSC hits rate limits

**Key Files**:
- `zerox_listener.py` - Main blockchain listener
- `zerox_transactions.db` - SQLite database
- `ZEROX_PROTOCOL_HANDOFF_PARTIALLY_WORKING.md`

### 🔍 **ButterSwap** (`butterswap/`)
**Status**: PARTIALLY WORKING  
**Last Tested**: August 20, 2025  
**Classification**: Technically functional but no ShapeShift affiliate transactions detected

**What Works**:
- ✅ Multi-chain connectivity (6/7 chains) - blockchain listener
- ✅ Web explorer connection and navigation
- ✅ Transaction element detection (32 found)
- ✅ Address copy-paste mechanism
- ✅ Database initialization and management
- ✅ Affiliate detection logic implementation

**What Doesn't Work**:
- ❌ No ButterSwap events detected in recent blockchain blocks
- ❌ No ShapeShift affiliate transactions found (web scraper)
- ❌ Both databases remain empty
- ❌ Avalanche chain connection fails
- ❌ BSC hits rate limits

**Key Files**:
- `butterswap_listener.py` - Blockchain-based listener
- `butterswap_web_scraper.py` - Web scraper for explorer
- `butterswap_transactions.db` - Blockchain listener database
- `butterswap_web_transactions.db` - Web scraper database
- `BUTTERSWAP_HANDOFF_PARTIALLY_WORKING.md`

### 🔄 **Relay** (`relay/`)
**Status**: PARTIALLY WORKING  
**Last Tested**: August 20, 2025  
**Classification**: Fundamental issues with event parsing and signatures

**What Works**:
- ✅ Connects to multiple EVM chains
- ✅ Database operations and CSV export
- ✅ Block scanning mechanics

**What Doesn't Work**:
- ❌ Incorrect event signature (`AffiliateFee` vs `ERC20AffiliateFee`)
- ❌ Event parsing errors and data corruption
- ❌ No valid affiliate transactions detected

**Key Files**:
- `csv_relay_listener.py` - Main relay listener
- `HANDOFF_RELAY_RELAY.md` - Issue documentation
- Transaction examples and debugging data

## 🚫 **Redundancy Prevention**

### **What NOT to Test Again**
Each folder contains comprehensive documentation of:
- ✅ **What was tested** and the results
- ✅ **What didn't work** and why
- ✅ **Technical implementation details**
- ✅ **Testing commands used**
- ✅ **Root cause analysis**

**DO NOT** retest basic functionality that has already been verified working.

### **What TO Test in Future**
Each folder contains specific guidance on:
- 🎯 **What TO test** when resuming development
- 🔧 **Alternative approaches** to investigate
- 🚀 **Next steps** for improvement
- 📊 **Root cause resolution** strategies

## 📊 **Overall Statistics**

| Listener | Status | Chains Working | Main Issue | Resolution Path |
|----------|--------|----------------|------------|-----------------|
| **Chainflip** | ⚠️ Partially | 5/5 | Transaction detection failed | API investigation needed |
| **0x Protocol** | ⚠️ Partially | 6/7 | No events found | Historical analysis needed |
| **ButterSwap** | ⚠️ Partially | 6/7 | No affiliate transactions | Alternative methods needed |
| **Relay** | ⚠️ Partially | 6/7 | Event parsing errors | Code fixes needed |

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

### **Immediate Actions**
1. **Review documentation** in each folder before any testing
2. **Follow redundancy prevention** guidelines
3. **Focus on resolution paths** rather than re-testing

### **Development Priorities**
1. **Chainflip**: Investigate alternative transaction detection methods
2. **0x Protocol**: Check historical activity and update event signatures
3. **ButterSwap**: Explore alternative data sources and detection patterns
4. **Relay**: Fix event signature and parsing issues

## 📚 **Documentation Standards**

Each partially working listener includes:
- **Comprehensive testing results** with specific commands used
- **Technical implementation details** and code analysis
- **Redundancy prevention** guidelines
- **Future testing** recommendations
- **Root cause analysis** and resolution paths

## 🏷️ **Classification Criteria**

**PARTIALLY WORKING** means:
- ✅ **Technical Infrastructure**: Core functionality works correctly
- ✅ **Data Processing**: Database and parsing logic is sound
- ❌ **Specific Issues**: One or more critical problems prevent production use
- ❌ **Data Generation**: No or insufficient affiliate transaction data
